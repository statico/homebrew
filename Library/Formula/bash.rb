    # it's non-interactively from sshd.  This allows the user to set
    # environment variables prior to running the command (e.g. PATH).  The
    # /bin/bash that ships with Mac OS X defines this, and without it, some
    # things (e.g. git+ssh) will break if the user sets their default shell to
    # Homebrew's bash instead of /bin/bash.
